# Contagion
Reproduction of model [1] used in the BBC Four Pandemic documentary "Contagion!".
## Data
`01 Data collation.ipynb`: For data sources, and code to convert given data into form accepted by model.
## Model
`02 Basic within patch.ipynb`: Full simulation can be difficult to break down, so this is here to mess around with and sanity check the within patch model.

`03 Full simulation.ipynb`: This brings everything together into one model that can be run and spit out results.
